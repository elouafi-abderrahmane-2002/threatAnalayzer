# MSP (Managed Service Provider) Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation transforms the threat analyzer platform into a full MSP solution with hierarchical tenant management. The system now supports:

1. **Super Admin** (MSP Owner) - Can manage all tenants and create tenant admins
2. **Tenant Admin** (Client Admin) - Can manage users within their specific tenant
3. **Tenant Users** (SOC Analysts, etc.) - Can only access their tenant's data with assigned roles

## Architecture Changes

### Database Schema Updates

#### New Columns Added:
- `clients.tenant_type` - Distinguishes between regular and MSP tenants
- `clients.created_by` - Tracks which super admin created the tenant
- `clients.admin_user_id` - References the primary admin for each tenant
- `profiles.tenant_level` - User hierarchy level (super_admin, tenant_admin, user)

#### New Tables:
- `tenant_audit_log` - Tracks all tenant operations for compliance

#### New Roles:
- **Tenant Admin** - Full access to tenant data and user management
- **SOC Analyst** - Read/write access to security data
- **SOC Viewer** - Read-only access to security data
- **Client User** - Basic access to reports and asset information

#### New Functions:
- `is_tenant_admin(user_uuid, client_uuid)` - Check if user is tenant admin for specific client
- `can_access_client(user_uuid, client_uuid)` - Check if user can access client data
- `get_user_client_id(user_uuid)` - Get user's client ID
- `create_tenant_admin_credentials()` - Helper for credential generation

### Updated RLS (Row Level Security) Policies

All data access is now properly isolated by tenant:
- Super admins can access all data
- Tenant admins can only access their tenant's data
- Users can only access data from their assigned tenant

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Super Admin Functionality

#### Tenant Creation
- Super admins can create new tenant clients through the admin panel
- Each tenant creation automatically generates an admin user account
- Secure password generation with credential display
- Audit logging for all tenant operations

#### Admin Credential Generation
- Auto-generates secure passwords for tenant admins
- Displays credentials securely (one-time view)
- Creates proper user profiles with tenant associations
- Assigns Tenant Admin role automatically

### 2. Tenant Admin Functionality

#### User Management Within Tenant
- Can create users within their tenant only
- Can assign roles (excluding Super Admin and Tenant Admin)
- Can manage user profiles for their tenant
- Cannot access other tenants' data

#### Available Roles for Assignment:
- **SOC Analyst** - Full security operations access
- **SOC Viewer** - Read-only security monitoring
- **Client User** - Basic report and asset access

### 3. Data Isolation

#### Dashboard Filtering
- All queries now respect tenant boundaries
- Non-super admins only see their tenant's data
- Automatic client selection for tenant users
- Prevents cross-tenant data access

#### Component Updates
- `SOCDashboard` - Filters all data by user's tenant
- `UserManagement` - Shows only tenant-specific users
- `TenantManagement` - Super admin only access

## Usage Guide

### For Super Admins (MSP Owners)

1. **Creating a New Tenant:**
   - Navigate to Admin → Tenant Management
   - Click "Create Tenant" tab
   - Fill in tenant and admin information
   - Choose to auto-generate or set custom password
   - Save credentials securely (shown only once)

2. **Managing Tenants:**
   - View all tenants in the tenant list
   - Edit tenant settings and configurations
   - Monitor tenant activity through audit logs

### For Tenant Admins

1. **Login Process:**
   - Use the email and password provided by the MSP
   - Upon login, automatically see only their tenant's data
   - Dashboard shows tenant-specific metrics only

2. **Creating Users:**
   - Navigate to Admin → User Management
   - Click "Create User"
   - Assign appropriate roles (SOC Analyst, SOC Viewer, etc.)
   - Share credentials securely with the user

3. **Managing Users:**
   - View all users within their tenant
   - Assign/remove roles as needed
   - Update user profiles and client associations

### For Tenant Users

1. **Access Control:**
   - Login with provided credentials
   - See only data from their assigned tenant
   - Access level determined by assigned roles
   - Cannot view or modify data from other tenants

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with tenant isolation
- Row-level security policies enforced at database level
- Secure credential generation and management

### Audit & Compliance
- All tenant operations logged in `tenant_audit_log`
- User creation and role assignments tracked
- Data access patterns monitored
- Compliance-ready audit trails

### Data Protection
- Complete tenant data isolation
- No cross-tenant data leakage
- Secure credential handling
- Encrypted password storage

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Components Modified:
- `TenantManagement.tsx` - Added creation functionality
- `TenantCreateForm.tsx` - New component for tenant creation
- `UserManagement.tsx` - Added tenant-aware user creation
- `SOCDashboard.tsx` - Implemented data filtering
- `useRBAC.ts` - Enhanced with tenant functions

### Backend Functions:
- Database migration: `20251002_msp_hierarchy.sql`
- Updated RLS policies for all tables
- New helper functions for tenant operations
- Enhanced user profile management

### Security Considerations:
- All database access goes through RLS policies
- Frontend filtering as additional security layer
- Credential display is one-time only
- Audit logs for compliance tracking

## Migration Path

To migrate existing data:
1. Run the new migration: `20251002_msp_hierarchy.sql`
2. Update existing users with appropriate `tenant_level`
3. Assign existing clients to super admin users
4. Update role assignments as needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Multi-factor authentication for admins
- Advanced tenant billing and usage tracking
- Custom branding per tenant
- API access for tenant integrations
- Advanced reporting and analytics per tenant

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check audit logs for operation tracking
2. Verify RLS policies are properly configured
3. Ensure user roles are correctly assigned
4. Test data isolation between tenants

The MSP implementation provides a complete multi-tenant security platform with proper isolation, role-based access, and comprehensive management capabilities.
